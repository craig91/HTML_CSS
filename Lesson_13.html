<!-- The th(table heading) element is used just like the td tag but its use is to represent the heading for either a column or a row
even if a cell has no content, the th tag should still be used because it needs to represent the presence of an empty cell, or else the 
table will not render correctly. You can use the scope attrib on the th to indicate whether it is a heading or a row. Col is column while row is just row -->
