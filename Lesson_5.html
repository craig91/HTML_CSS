<!-- If you want to add an image, you need to use the <img src ""> tag, with this tag you need the source of the img. This is what the "src" means.
you can use an image file locally or you can use one from the net. every image on the net has a URL you can use to put as the source -->
<p>This is how you turn the image file into a link.</p>

<!-- you use hte <a href> tag to add a link to your page and then directly you use the <img src> tag to turn the link in to an image a person can click on
then they will be reditected to the site you linked your image too. -->
